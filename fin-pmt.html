<!--
A headless element for calculating the payment per period for a fixed rate loan. Example:

    <fin-pmt
      rate="0.049"
      nper="60"
      principal="460.77"
      final-balance="460.77"
      value="{{payment}}"></fin-pmt>

    <b>Payment Amount</b> <span>[[payment]]</span>

The expected usage of this element is setting the properties described below
and binding an element in your UI to the `value` property to be notified of
calculation changes.
